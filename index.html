        <h2>Why Trust Us?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>As someone who has lived in Cork for a whole 20 years, I feel I have some sort of idea what stands out to me as places that need more explosure.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As a huge foodie and an avid sports supporter of almost every sport, I think I have an open mind towards new things I have explored the last number of years in Cork and want to share my love for certain spaces!</p>
